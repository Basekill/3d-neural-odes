# 3D Neural ODEs

Uses Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to fit 3D parametric curves.

Modified version of https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq/blob/master/examples/ode_demo.py
to allow for 3D parametric functions.

Also sketches the associated 3D vector field using `--vecfield`
However, the 3D vector field slows down the program considerably.
